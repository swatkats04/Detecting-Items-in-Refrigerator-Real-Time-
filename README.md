# Detecting-Items-in-Refrigerator-Real-Time-

## About The Project
In this project we will how to perform real time object detection under the environments of Collab and to be specific we are going to train yoloV3 with custom objects in Collab and perform the object detection with the use of open CV.

## Objective
Performing object detections on the custom images that we used. 
(Which means the model is applied to multiple regions within an image and then the model compute scores to an image at multiple locations and scales, high scores regions of an image are considered as an object is detected)

## Data description
Downloaded using “Download All Images” plugin (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/download-all-images/ifipmflagepipjokmbdecpmjbibjnakm?hl=en).

Labelled the images using “labelimg” (https://tzutalin.github.io/labelImg/).

9 classes(apple,banana,cake,orange,milk)
